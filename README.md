First Person Camera Continued provides a smoother and more realistic first-person camera controller.

## Features
- **First-Person Camera Mode**: Immerse yourself in your city like never before with a first-person view.
- **Easy Toggle**: Activate or deactivate the camera mode with a simple shortcut - `CTRL+F`.
- **Sprinting**: Use `LEFT SHIFT` to increase movement speed.
- **Height Adjustment** Use `RF` keys to move height of camera up and down
- **Follow Mode**: Hold the `right mouse button` whilst in first person, you can now see highlighted entities when you hover them. Release the right mouse button to then follow that entity. Moving with the `WASD` keys will go into manual mode.
- **Enhanced Realism**: Experience a more realistic view compared to the standard photo mode camera in the vanilla game.
