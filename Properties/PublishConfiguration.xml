# Notes

- Hold the right mouse button but don't release while in free camera first person mode to view the highlighted object before going into follow mode
- Unsubscribe from the First Person Camera Temporary Reupload by Nyoko, or the original First Person Camera mod by H3llb0und to prevent compatibility issues
