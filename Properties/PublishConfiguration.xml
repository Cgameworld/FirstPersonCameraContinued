# Intro

First Person Camera Continued allows you to explore your city from the perspective of a cim either with a free camera near ground level or by following any cim/vehicle.

This mod is a continuation of the First Person Camera mod by optimus-code (H3llb0und) with new features.

# How To Use

To enter free camera first person mode, click on the video camera icon near the upper right hand corner and click "Enter Free Camera" from the dropdown or press Alt+F on your keyboard.

To move around use WASD, use SHIFT to walk faster and R/F keys to increase/decrease the camera height.

To enter follow mode, right click on an object in free camera first person mode or click on the video camera button in the info panel for the object. Alternatively, choose the "Follow Random Cim" or "Follow Random Vehicle" options in the dropdown that appears after clicking the main mod button to find a random cim/vehicle in your city to follow.

To shift the camera forwards or backwards in follow mode press the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys, to change the height use the R/F keys.

To exit follow mode press WASD, to exit first person mode, press ESC or ALT+F.
