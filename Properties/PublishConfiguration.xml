# Intro

First Person Camera Continued allows you to explore your city from the perspective of a cim either with a free camera near ground level or by following any cim/vehicle.

This mod is a continuation of the First Person Camera mod by optimus-code (H3llb0und) with new features.

# How To Use

To enter first person mode, click on the video camera icon near the upper right hand corner or press Alt+F on your keyboard

To move around use WASD, use SHIFT to walk faster and R/F keys to increase/decrease the camera height

To enter follow mode, right click on an object in free camera first person mode

To shift the camera forwards or backwards in follow mode press the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys

To exit follow mode press WASD, to exit first person mode, press ESC

# Settings

Several loaded parameters can also be configured from the main game settings, taking effect at the start of each first person session, specifically:

- FOV
- Walking Speed
- Running Speed
- Cim Height

# Notes

- Hold the right mouse button but don't release while in free camera first person mode to view the highlighted object before going into follow mode
- Unsubscribe from the First Person Camera Temporary Reupload by Nyoko, or the original First Person Camera mod by H3llb0und to prevent compatibility issues
